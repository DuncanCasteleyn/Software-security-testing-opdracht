<h1>Instructions</h1>
<h2>Used browser</h2>
<p>The browser that was used to test the exploits is Firefox. Internet explorer and Chrome bot block most attacks,
    Firefox does not because it strictly follow the http standard rules</p>
<h2>Index page</h2>
<p>The index page contains all the pages that have been created for this project you will be able to navigate to all the
    pages.</p>
<p>On the index page all links will be opened in a new tab so you can leave the tabs open for reviewing except the XSS
    Attacks link because that brings you to a page with a list of XSS attack pages.</p>
<h2>XSS Attacks</h2>
<p>This page contains navigation to the various XSS attacks, these links will also open in a new page.</p>
<h3>Type 0</h3>
<p>The type 0 attack page uses a dom document.write to display the current URL. Because of this it's vulnerable for DOM0
    attacks anything in the url will be executed.</p>
<p>As an example the url on the navigation page includes a script alert that is executed without much issues.</p>
<h3>XSRF</h3>
<p>You can log into this page with the username: "root" and the password: "root".</p>
<p>You should end up on the same page but this time but with memos. This means a cookie loggedInAs with a random
    generated is should be saved on the browser.</p>
<p>You can then close the browser open it again and enter the url "http://localhost:8080/XSRF.jsp?delete=1" to delete
    one of the memos.</p>
<h3>Header splitting</h3>
<p>This is the only attack i was not able to replicate using a .jsp page.</p>
<p>The value to perform such an attack is already filled you'll notice that once you submit it you get a page that says
    "Welcome Hacker manContent-Length: 166Content-Type: text/html;charset=UTF-8hello".
</p>
<p>You'll notice that if you refresh the page you will only get Hacker man and if you check your cookies you'll see the
    actual value of the cookie that is being read which is "Hacker manContent-Length: 166Content-Type: text/html"</p>
<p>I'm guessing my response is being ignored by the browser. I also tried hard coding the response with no success see
    the src folder for the jsp source files.</p>
<h2>SQL injection</h2>
<p>You'll see a list of items you can search on those items by entering for example
    "http://localhost:8080/sqlinject.jsp?search=fuze%20tea".</p>
<p>if you want to destroy this database enter
    "http://localhost:8080/sqlinject.jsp?search=%27%3B+drop+table+ARTICLES%3B--" then reload the page and
    enjoy the 500 error.</p>
<p>If you had no idea which table was being used you could have used "http://localhost:8080/sqlinject.jsp?search=%27--" to cause an exception revealing the sql syntax</p>

        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <h2>Used browser</h2>
        <p>The browser that was used to test the exploits is Firefox. Internet explorer and Chrome both block most
            attacks,
            Firefox does not because it strictly follows the http standard rules</p>
        <h2>Index page</h2>
        <p>The index page contains all links to the pages that have been created for this project in the top bar </p>
        <p>On the index page all links will be opened in a new tab so you can leave the tabs open for reviewing except
            the XSS Attacks link because that brings you to a page with a list of XSS attack pages.</p>
        <h2>XSS Attacks</h2>
        <p>This page contains navigation to the various XSS attacks, these links will also open in a new page.</p>
        <h3>Type 0</h3>
        <p>The type 0 attack page uses a dom document.write to display the current URL. Because of this it's vulnerable
            for
            DOM0
            attacks anything in the url will be executed.</p>
        <p>As an example the url on the navigation page includes a script alert that is executed without much
            issues.</p>
        <h3>XSRF</h3>
        <p>You can log into this page with the username: "root" and the password: "root".</p>
        <p>You should end up on the same page but this time but with memos. This means a cookie loggedInAs with a random
            generated is should be saved on the browser.</p>
        <p>You can then close the browser open it again and enter the url "http://localhost:8080/XSRF.jsp?delete=1" to
            delete
            one of the memos.</p>
        <p>You can reset the memos to their original state by pressing the reset memos button under the memos.</p>
        <h3>Header splitting</h3>
        <p>This is the only attack i was not able to replicate using a .jsp page.</p>
        <p>The value to perform such an attack is already filled you'll notice that once you submit it you get a page
            that says "Welcome Hacker manContent-Length: 166Content-Type: text/html;charset=UTF-8hello".
        </p>
        <p>You'll notice that if you refresh the page you will only get Hacker man and if you check your cookies you'll
            see the
            actual value of the cookie that is being read which is "Hacker manContent-Length: 166Content-Type:
            text/html"</p>
        <p>This is because the issue has been resolved since Tomcat 6 and tomcat 5 requires jre 5 which i can't run on
            this server because i'm running a java 9 application on this server.</p>
        <h2>SQL injection</h2>
        <p>You'll see a list of items you can search on those items by entering for example
            "http://localhost:8080/sqlinject.jsp?search=fuze%20tea".</p>
        <p>if you want to destroy this database enter
            "http://localhost:8080/sqlinject.jsp?search=%27%3B+drop+table+ARTICLES%3B--" then reload the page and
            enjoy the 500 error, after doing this however you will be unable to perform further sql commands.</p>
        <p>If you had no idea which table was being used you could have used
            "http://localhost:8080/sqlinject.jsp?search=%27--"
            to cause an exception revealing the sql syntax</p>
